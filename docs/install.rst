Install
=======

The latest releases of **Tonic** are available on pypi, so you can just type
::

  pip install tonic

**Tonic** is also available via conda! If you prefer to use conda, please follow
the instructions as `outlined here <https://github.com/conda-forge/tonic-feedstock>`_.

Requirements
------------
Tonic is based on PyTorch Vision, which in turn is based on PyTorch. This is by far the largest
dependency. Apart from that, there are a few minor packages that help with decoding file formats,
such as h5py, importRosbag, aedat, loris and others.

Supported platforms
--------------------
This being a Python only package, support across platforms should be without issues
for the most part. 
If you run into any problems installing it on your system, please open a Github issue and
we'll look into it.
